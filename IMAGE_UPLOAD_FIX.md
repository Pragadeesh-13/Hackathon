# Image Upload Fix Summary

## Problem
The Streamlit app was failing when users uploaded images with the error:
```
PIL.UnidentifiedImageError: cannot identify image file UploadedFile(...)
```

## Root Cause
The `Image.open()` function was trying to read a Streamlit `UploadedFile` object directly, but this object needs special handling to access its file buffer.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed Image Loading (`app.py`)
- Added `uploaded_file.seek(0)` to reset file pointer to beginning
- Added proper error handling with user-friendly messages
- Added file size validation (10MB limit)
- Added file type validation for supported formats

### 2. Enhanced Validation
- File size check (max 10MB)
- File type validation (JPEG, JPG, PNG, WebP)
- Better error messages for users

### 3. Updated Deprecated Parameters
- Changed `use_column_width=True` to `use_container_width=True`

## Code Changes Made

```python
# Before:
image = Image.open(uploaded_file).convert('RGB')

# After:
try:
    uploaded_file.seek(0)  # Reset file pointer
    image = Image.open(uploaded_file).convert('RGB')
except Exception as e:
    st.error(f"Error loading image: {e}")
    st.error("Please make sure you uploaded a valid image file")
    st.stop()
```

## Testing
- Created `test_image_loading.py` to verify the fix
- All tests pass âœ…
- Streamlit app restarted with fixes

## Result
The app now properly handles uploaded images and provides better user feedback for invalid files.
