## üöÄ Current Server Status

- **Server URL:** `http://172.16.45.105:5000`
- **Model Accuracy:** 87.1%
- **Supported Breeds:** 11 cattle breeds
- **Status:** ‚úÖ OPERATIONAL

## üìã For MAC Developer - Quick Connection Steps

### 1. Test Connection First
```bash
# Run this on your Mac terminal to test connectivity
curl http://172.16.45.105:5000/health
```

If you get a response, you're connected! If not, run the firewall setup below.

### 2. Enable Windows Firewall (if needed)
On the Windows PC, run as Administrator:
```batch
.\setup_firewall.bat
```

### 3. Use in Your React App
```javascript
// In your React app, use this base URL
const API_BASE_URL = 'http://172.16.45.105:5000';

// Example: Predict breed from image
const predictBreed = async (imageFile) => {
  const formData = new FormData();
  formData.append('image', imageFile);
  
  const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE_URL}/predict`, {
    method: 'POST',
    body: formData
  });
  
  return await response.json();
};
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Server Won't Start
```powershell
# Reinstall dependencies
pip install flask flask-cors

# Check if port is busy
netstat -an | findstr :5000
```

### Mac Can't Connect
1. Run `setup_firewall.bat` as Administrator on Windows
2. Check Windows Defender/Antivirus settings
3. Verify both devices are on same network
4. Test with: `curl http://172.16.45.105:5000/health`

### Model Not Loading
- Ensure all model files exist in `/models/` folder
- Check terminal output for error messages
- Verify Python environment has all required packages
