INDIAN CATTLE & BUFFALO BREED HANDBOOK

(Technical Reference — v2.0 for MCP/Gemini Simulation)

SECTION A – CATTLE BREEDS
1. GIR (Bos indicus)

Origin & Distribution: Kathiawar region of Gujarat; now spread across India and South America (notably Brazil’s Gir Leiteiro).

Morphology:

Forehead highly convex (“bullock head”), broad poll.

Ears long, pendulous, with inward curl at tips.

Coat: red to white, with speckled patterns.

Body weight: cows 300–430 kg (mean ≈ 380 kg); bulls 500–600 kg.

Height at withers: cows ~122 cm, bulls ~135 cm.

Udder well-developed, prominent teats.

Production:

Average lactation yield: 1900–2600 L (some elite animals >3500 L).

Fat%: 4.5–5.0 (SNF 8.2–8.8).

Peak yield: 6–8 weeks post-calving.

Reproduction:

Age at first calving: 38–45 mo.

Calving interval: 400–450 days (can drop to 380 with high-input feeding).

Service period: 130–150 days.

Wood’s Model Parameters (example):

a=9.5, b=0.22, c=0.0035 (yields realistic curve with moderate persistency).

Genetics & Health:

A2 milk producer (β-casein A2).

High tick & helminth resistance.

Heat tolerance index >85 (on Benezra scale).

Socio-Economic Role:

Prime dairy zebu; exported for tropical dairy development.

Simulation Notes:

Should respond strongly to improved feeding → +20–30 % yield.

Mortality risk very low even under heat stress; fertility remains fairly robust.

2. SAHIWAL

Morphology:

Coat: reddish dun, sometimes with white patches.

Large barrel chest, loose skin, broad forehead.

Avg weight: cows 400–500 kg; bulls 500–600 kg.

Production:

305-day yield: 2500–3500 L in organized farms.

Fat%: 4.6–5.0; SNF ~8.5.

Very good lactation persistency — curve flatter than Gir.

Reproduction:

AFC 34–40 mo; ICI 380–420 days.

Conception rate: 50–60 % at first service.

Traits:

Excellent heat tolerance, one of most productive zebu.

Frequently used in crossbreeding with Holstein/Jersey.

Simulation Notes:

Use as “high-yield indicus” base breed; show improvement under crossbreeding modules.

3. THARPARKAR

Morphology:

White/grey coat, black points. Medium frame, compact body.

Weight: cows 300–400 kg.

Production:

Yield: 1200–2200 L; fat ≈ 4.5 %.

Milk has slightly higher SNF than Gir.

Adaptation:

Survives extreme desert heat (up to 48°C).

Can maintain lactation under sparse grazing.

Simulation Notes:

Highest survival parameter under drought; scale down milk yield only slightly under feed restriction.

4. KANKREJ

Morphology:

Large frame, lyre-shaped horns, silver-grey coat with black muzzle.

Weight: cows 420–500 kg.

Production:

Milk yield 1500–2500 L; fat ~4.8 %.

Also excellent draught breed.

Simulation Notes:

Add “draught work capacity” attribute: 1.2× that of Ongole under same feeding.

5. ONGOLE

Morphology:

Very large white/grey indicus, straight back, muscular legs.

Bulls weigh 500–600 kg.

Production:

Yield: 1000–1500 L; fat ~4.2 %.

Mostly draught breed, milk is secondary.

Simulation Notes:

Focus on work power rather than milk. Mortality extremely low, even under vector-borne disease outbreaks.

SECTION B – BUFFALO BREEDS
6. MURRAH

Morphology:

Jet black, compact frame, short tightly curled horns.

Weight: cows 450–500 kg.

Production:

Milk yield 2000–2700 kg (elite >4000 kg).

Fat 7–8 % → very high solids.

Persistency excellent — use very low c value in lactation model.

Reproduction:

AFC 36–42 mo; ICI ~450 days.

Simulation Notes:

High economic value breed; keep “price multiplier” highest.

7. JAFFARABADI

Morphology:

Largest buffalo, heavy drooping horns, massive head.

Weight: 500–700 kg.

Production:

Milk 1500–2000 kg; fat 8–8.5 %.

Strong draught capacity.

Simulation Notes:

Model low frequency population but very high fat% contribution.

8. SURTI

Morphology:

Medium-sized, sickle-shaped horns, wedge-shaped body.

Weight: 400–450 kg.

Production:

1200–1800 kg; fat 7.5–8 %.

Simulation Notes:

Give best “feed efficiency” coefficient — low input, moderate yield.

9. BHADAWARI

Morphology:

Coppery coat, distinctive white markings (“kanth mala”).

Weight: 350–400 kg.

Production:

800–1500 kg yield, but fat 9–10 %.

Ideal for ghee production models.

10. MEHSANA

Morphology:

Intermediate between Murrah & Surti.

Black or brown coat, semi-curved horns.

Production:

Milk yield 1800–2400 kg; fat 6.5–7.5 %.

Good persistency, moderate AFC (~40 mo).

SECTION C – SIMULATION DESIGN NOTES

Wood Model Parameters (Example):

Murrah: a=11.0, b=0.20, c=0.0025

Sahiwal: a=10.0, b=0.25, c=0.0032

Bhadawari: a=7.0, b=0.20, c=0.0050 (steep decline)

Nutrition Sensitivity Coefficients:

Cattle: yield reduction 0.8× under low feed

Fertility:

Base conception rate 50–60 %; reduce 10–15 % under heat stress

Mortality:

Lowest: Tharparkar, Ongole

Highest: Surti under humid conditions
